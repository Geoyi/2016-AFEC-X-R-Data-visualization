## A bit introduction 

Hi all, Welcome to AFEC-X 2016 class in Xishuangbanna. This is Zhuangfang Yi; I was one of AFEC-X 2009 students. I met most amazing, bright and hardworking people in my class in 2009, who keep inspiring me academically and in my life onward.I still kept in touch most of them, and hope you all enjoy being with each other in the field course and also learned a lot new knowledge on ecology, conservation, and other fancy field design and modeling stuff from your different tutors and classmates.Take as much as you can.

Before we start the classes, I need you guys to start install R and Rstudio.
